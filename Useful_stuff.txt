I'm trying to save some of the stuff I've learned while doing this.

- Multiple Windows with Tkinter (tk.TopLevel())
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43552320/can-i-open-two-tkinter-windows-at-the-same-time
 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tkinter-toplevel-widget/
 - https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-toplevel/
 - Note: (1) There can be only one root window, and one root.mainloop().
        (2) If you close the root, you close them all.

- __repr__() vs __str__()
  - Python uses the __repr__ method to determine what to
    put in the spot in the list.
