- Improve __getitem__ in Deck class to take care of slices.

- Improve Card class to the more acceptable suit inputs.
  For example "h" or "hearts" or "Hearts" etc.

- Simplify contains method: Instead of iterating through the deck, 
  you can use the any function with a generator expression for a more 
  concise implementation:

  def contains(self, rank, suit) -> bool:
    return any(card.rank() == rank and card.suit() == suit for card in self._deckCards)

- Fix naming conventions
- In Card class maybe rename id() method
