02/02/2024
- In Cards.py:
  - CardColor class:
    - Added a self.c variable to save the color in str.
    - A __copy__ method was added.
    - In the __eq__(), raise a TypeError instead of an Exception.
  - Card class:
    - Added a __copy__ method
    - Fix bug in  __eq__():
      self.suit() == self.suit() to self.suit() == other.suit()
  - Deck class:
    - __copy__() and __deepcopy__() methods were implemented.
------------------------------------------------------------------
08/02/2024
- In Cards.py:
  - class SuitDeck created
  - class Card:
    - rename setter methods with underscore.
    - change _set_value().
      Now J -> 11, Q -> 12 and K -> 13.
      This change was necessary for easier implementation 
      of the push() method in SuitDeck. 
  - class Deck updated:
    - top() method added.
